# Townspark - Local Issue Reporting Platform

## What is Townspark?

Townspark is a web-based platform designed to help community members report and track local issues in their neighborhood. Think of it as a digital complaint box for your community where you can report problems like:

- Potholes on roads
- Graffiti on walls
- Broken streetlights
- Damaged sidewalks
- Any other community problems

The main goal is to create a bridge between residents and local authorities, making it easier for problems to be noticed, reported, and eventually fixed.

## Key Features

- **Easy Issue Reporting**: Simple forms to report problems in your community
- **Photo Upload**: Take a picture of the problem and attach it to your report for better documentation
- **Community Discussion**: Comment on issues and discuss potential solutions with other residents
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works perfectly on phones, tablets, and computers - report issues from anywhere
- **Issue Tracking**: Follow the progress of reported issues from submission to resolution

## User Types and Permissions

Townspark has two types of users, each with different capabilities:

### 1. **Normal Users (Regular Community Members)**

These are everyday residents who use the platform. They can:

- **Report Issues**: Create new reports about problems they see in their community
- **View Issues**: See all issues reported by everyone in the community
- **Comment**: Share their thoughts or additional information about any issue
- **Like Issues**: Show support for issues that need attention
- **Update Their Own Issues**: Edit or update the status of issues they personally reported
- **Delete Their Own Issues**: Remove issues they created if needed

### 2. **Admin Users (Community Managers)**

These are trusted individuals who help manage the platform. They have all the powers of normal users, plus:

- **Manage All Issues**: Can edit or update any issue, not just their own
- **Assign to Authorities**: Forward issues to the relevant local government departments
- **Delete Any Issue**: Can remove inappropriate or duplicate reports
- **Monitor Platform**: Keep an eye on the overall health of the community reporting system

Please note that admins do NOT directly fix issues themselves; they act as intermediaries between residents and local authorities. This is a issue REPORTING platform, not a problem FIXING platform.

### Important Permission Rules

- **Deleting Issues**: Only the person who reported an issue OR an admin can delete it
- **Editing Issues**: Only the person who reported an issue OR an admin can edit its details
- **Commenting**: Anyone can comment on any issue

## 🔄 How Does the Platform Work? (Step-by-Step Workflow)

Let's walk through a typical scenario of how an issue gets reported and tracked:

### Step 1: Spotting the Problem

A resident notices a problem in their neighborhood (for example, a large pothole on Main Street).

### Step 2: Logging In

The resident opens the Townspark website and logs into their account.

### Step 3: Reporting the Issue

The resident fills out a simple form with:

- A description of the problem ("Large pothole on Main Street near the library")
- The location (address or area)
- A photo of the pothole (optional but helpful)
- Category (road damage, public safety, etc.)

### Step 4: Issue Becomes Public

Once submitted, the issue appears on the platform where other community members can see it, comment on it, or "like" it to show it affects them too.

### Step 5: Admin Review

An admin user logs in, sees the new issue, reviews the details, and decides which local authority should handle it (in this case, the Public Works Department).

### Step 6: Communication with Authorities

The admin contacts the relevant authority outside the platform (via phone, email, etc.) and forwards the issue to them. This communication happens offline.

### Step 7: Status Updates

As the admin receives updates from the authority, they log back into Townspark and update the issue status:

- "Pending" → The issue is waiting to be reviewed
- "In Progress" → Someone is working on fixing it
- "Resolved" → The problem has been fixed

### Step 8: Community Notification

Users who reported or are following the issue can see these status updates and know the progress being made.

## Important Understanding: What This Platform IS and ISN'T

- This is just a issue REPORTING app not a problem FIXING app.

so please understand the difference.

- the admin will only work as a middleman to push your issues to the concerned authorities. and also follow up with them to get updates.

**This Platform IS:**

- A reporting tool for documenting community issues
- A tracking system to monitor progress
- A communication channel between residents and admins

**This Platform IS NOT:**

- A direct line to government authorities (admins handle that communication separately)
- A tool for actually fixing problems (fixing happens in the real world, offline)
- A guarantee that issues will be solved immediately

**The Admin's Role:**
Think of admins as "middlemen" or coordinators. They:

- Receive issue reports from the platform
- Contact the appropriate authorities outside the platform
- Follow up with authorities if needed
- Update the platform with progress information

Once an admin hands off an issue to an authority, they don't directly solve it themselves - they just keep the platform updated with whatever information the authorities provide them.
